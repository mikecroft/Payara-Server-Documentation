= Enabling Hazelcast

In the default domain configuration of Payara, Hazelcast is not enabled.

It can be enabled either through the Admin Console, or by using a command line
_asadmin_ command.

== Enabling Hazelcast through the Admin Console

From the Admin Console home:

. Select the instance's configuration from the page tree:

. Click the "Hazelcast" button to view the "Hazelcast Configuration" page:
+

. Check "Enabled" (and optionally "Dynamic" to apply the configuration without a
restart) and save.

== Enabling Hazelcast using Asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` asadmin command requires you to
specify whether or not Hazelcast is enabled each time you run it. This
command is also used to configure Hazelcast, which is covered
link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/hazelcast/configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin[in the configuration section].
The command requires the Admin Server to be running, and will expect it to be listening
on port **4848** unless specified differently with the asadmin utility `--port` option.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true
----

If no target is specified, the command will enable Hazelcast on the
domain configuration _(server-config)_. To enable Hazelcast on another
instance or cluster, use the `--target` option like so:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true --target=${Target}
----

The `dynamic` option of the asadmin command defaults to true, so to
enable Hazelcast and require a restart of the target instance/cluster, use
`--dynamic=false`:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=false
----
