= Configuring Hazelcast

Payara Server supports configuring Hazelcast through the Admin Console and
asadmin commands. The Hazelcast configuration file can also be directly edited,
but will not be covered in  depth in this section.

Using a Hazelcast configuration file will cause the settings set via the Admin
Console and _asadmin_ commands to be ignored. Any parameters not specified in
the configuration file reverting to the Hazelcast defaults, even if they are
specified in the Admin Console or _domain.xml_ (Note - the
link::https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-default.xml[Hazelcast defaults]
are not necessarily the same as the Payara Hazelcast defaults).

== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File with the Admin Console

To set the Hazelcast configuration from a Hazelcast Configuration file:

. Select the instance's configuration from the page tree and click the
*Hazelcast* button to view the _"Hazelcast Configuration"_ page:
+

. On the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page, add the path to your Hazelcast
Configuration file and click "Save". This path is relative to your domain
configuration directory:
+

== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File using asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command can be used to set the configuration
file:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --hazelcastconfigurationfile /path/to/file --enabled=true
----

As with the admin console, this path is relative to your domain configuration
directory.

=== Configuring Hazelcast with the Admin Console

Navigate to the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page of your instances configuration.

image::/images/hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-hazelcast-options.png[Payara 4.1.2.172 Hazelcast Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description
|Enabled |Whether or not Hazelcast is enabled.

|Dynamic |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be
restarted to apply any changes made

|Override Configuration File |Specifies the Hazelcast configuration file
to use. The path specified is relative to the domain config directory.

If you are using a custom GlassFish server configuration for a cluster
or standalone instance (e.g. _cluster-config_), then the Hazelcast
configuration file should be placed in the directory with the same name
(e.g. <domain-root>/config/cluster-config). This will ensure it is
replicated to the node during startup.

Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause
all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast
configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.

|Cluster Group Name | Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be optionally used
 to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e. _dev-group_,
   _prod-group_).

|Cluster Group Password |Specifies the password used to access the Hazelcast
group.

|Start Port | The port to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port
specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.

|Multicast Port |The multicast port for communications in the Hazelcast
cluster.

|Multicast Group |The multicast group for communications in the
Hazelcast cluster.

|JNDI Name |The JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast instance to.

|License Key |Enables

features.

|Lite Cluster Member|If set to true, cluster members with this configuration
will be Hazelcast "lite" nodes, meaning they will not store any cache data
locally and rely on other cluster members to store data.

|Host Aware Partitioning |Whether or not to enable
link::http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning]
 for the cluster.
Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled
on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for
this feature to work correctly.
|====

Enter your required values, and click _Save_. Restarting the domain or
instance/cluster is not necessary for any changes made to take effect, provided
that _"Dynamic"_ remains set to "_true_"

[[configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin]]
== Configuring Hazelcast using Asadmin

As noted in the enable Hazelcast section, the `set-hazelcast-configuration`
asadmin command is used to both enable/disable Hazelcast, and to
configure it. You can pass the ``--help` option to the command to see
usage instructions and available arguments in your terminal, both of which
are listed below:

[cols=(,,,,),options="header"]
|====
|Option|Type|Description|Default|Mandatory
|`--enabled`| Boolean| Enables Hazelcast. If no `target` is specified, this
will enable Hazelcast on the domain configuration _(server-config)_.

If no arguments are specified, defaults to _true_.

If other options are specified, asadmin will interactively prompt for
`--enabled`.| _false_ | Yes

|`--target`|Config Name|Specifies the instance or cluster to configure.
|`server-config`|No

|`--dynamic` |Boolean|Enable or disable dynamic stopping and starting of the
embedded Hazelcast member.|_false_|No
|`--hazelcast-configuration-file`

`-f`|File Path |The Hazelcast configuration file to
use. This path is relative to the domain config directory,
`<Payara Installation Directory>/glassfish/domains/<Domain Name>/config/`.

Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause
all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast
configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.|`hazelcast-config.xml`
| No

|`--startport` |Port Number|The port to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy,
the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found. |5900 |No

|`--multicastgroup`

`-g` |Multicast Address|The multicast group for
communications in the Hazelcast instance.|224.2.2.3|No

|`--multicastport` |Port Number |The multicast port for communications in the Hazelcast
instance.|54327|No

|`--clustername` |Group Name|Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be
optionally used to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e.
_dev-group_, _prod_group_).||No

|`--clusterpassword` |Password|Specifies the password used to access the
Hazelcast group.||No

|`--jndiname`

`-j` |JNDI Name|Specifies the JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast
instance to.||

|`--licensekey`

`-lk` |Hazelcast License|Enables link::https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/[Hazelcast Enterprise]
features.||No

|`--lite` |Boolean|Sets the cluster to lite mode, where it will cluster but *not*
store any cluster data.|_false_|No

|`--hostawarepartitioning` |Boolean|Whether or not to enable
link::http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning]
 for the cluster.
Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled
on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for this
feature to work correctly.|_false_|No

|`--help`

`-?` ||Displays the help menu.|_false_|No

The following example demonstrates setting all of the options on a
cluster called _cluster1_:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=true --target=cluster1 --dynamic=true -f hazelcast-config.xml --startport=5902 -g 224.2.2.3 --multicastport=6666 --hostAwareParitioning=true -j payara/Hazelcast
