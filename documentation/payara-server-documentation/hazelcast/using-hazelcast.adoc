= Using Hazelcast in your Applications

The following sections will detail how to use the Hazelcast embedded in
Payara within your code.

[[accessing-the-jndi-registered-hazelcast-instance]]
== Accessing the JNDI registered Hazelcast instance

By default, the JNDI name of the hazelcast instance is
_payara/Hazelcast_, though this can be altered using the
`set-hazelcast-configuration` command.

You will need to import the following packages into your Java class:

[source, java]
----
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
----

To import the Hazelcast package, you will need to set the Payara
Hazelcast package as a dependency in the project _pom.xml_ file (for
Maven projects), or have the Hazelcast JAR set as a project
dependency (if using a non-Maven based project). To add the Payara
Hazelcast package as a dependency in a POM, enter the following in the
dependencies section:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>payara-api</artifactId>
  <version>{{ book.currentVersion }}</version>
</dependency>
----

The Hazelcast JAR (for non-Maven projects), can either be downloaded
from the link::http://hazelcast.org/download/[Hazelcast website], or you can
make use of the JAR packaged with Payara. The JAR packaged with Payara
can be found at _<Payara Installation Directory>/glassfish/modules/hazelcast.jar_.

The following will initialize a `HazelcastInstance` variable in the
instance embedded in Payara:

[source, java]
----
Context ctx = new InitialContext();
HazelcastInstance instance = (HazelcastInstance) ctx.lookup("payara/Hazelcast");
----

You will have to wrap this in a `try-catch` clause, or throw the
`NamingException` exception that this code can generate.
