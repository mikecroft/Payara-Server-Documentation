= Production Ready Domain

_Since Payara Server 4.1.153_

Payara Server comes with a default domain, `domain1`, which has been
inherited from GlassFish. This domain (and its accompanying template)
has not been modified in any way for Payara Server. The default domain is not, however,
designed to be run in production but to be a usable example for
development and testing purposes.

Since the creation of `domain1` in GlassFish, there have been changes in
how the server is used, along with the changes implemented by the Payara
development team. To better highlight these changes and new features,
the `payaradomain` was created.

[[usage]]
== Usage

`payaradomain` is located in the default directory for domains
`${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/domains/`, alongside `domain1`. This means it
can be used as-is by simply naming the domain after running the
`start-domain` subcommand and without specifying the domain directory
location:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-domain payaradomain
----

Alternatively, many Payara Server users completely delete existing
domains and recreate their own domains with custom settings.
`payaradomain` can be used here too, since the domain is also provided
as a template in the `${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/common/templates/gf`
directory. You will need to specify the full path to the location of the
template jar as follows:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> create-domain --template ${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/common/templates/gf/payara-domain.jar myNewPayaraDomain
----

[[differences-to-domain1]]
== Differences to `domain1`

The configuration of `payaradomain` has been made with production in
mind, so there are a number of differences when compared to `domain1`
which are listed below. Not all of these will be wanted for development
environments, but all are good practice for production domains.

=== Differences in Server Configuration

1.  Autodeployment has been disabled.
* Payara Server comes with a deployment scanner. This is a security risk
for production, so it is disabled by default in the domain.xml.
2.  Dynamic application reloading is disabled.
* For the same reason as above, this is disabled by default in the
domain.xml
3.  Dynamic reloading of JSP pages in `default-web.xml` is disabled.
* The `<init-param>` setting `reload-interval` in the default-web.xml has
been set to a value of `-1` so that it is disabled.
4.  The EJB container `max-pool-size` has been set to `128`
5.  The `max-thread-pool-size` setting for `thread-pool-1` has been
increased to `250`.
6.  File caching has been enabled for both default HTTP listeners
(`http-listener-1` and `http-listener-2`).
7.  Isolated classloading has been enabled by default at the server
level.
* The property `fish.payara.classloading.delegate` has been set to `false`.
8.  A default transaction timeout of 300 seconds has been added for xa
and non-xa transactions.
9.  Default group-to-role mapping is enabled.
10. The maximum size for the thread pool `http-thread-pool` has been
increased from `5` to `50`.

=== Differences in JVM Options

With the aim of `payaradomain` being to target production, `payaradomain` has
JVM options specifically configured for usage on JDK 8. Since JDK 7 has
reached its end-of-life, it is therefore a security risk to run a JVM lower
than version 8 in production. However, `payaradomain` can be configured to
run on JDK 7 if necessary by editing the JVM options.

The following JVM options only appear in `payaradomain`:

* `-XX:+UseG1GC`
* `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication`
* `-Xmx2g`
* `-Xms2g`

The following JVM options only appear in `domain1`:

* `-XX:MaxPermSize=192m`
* `-Djavax.management.builder.initial=com.sun.enterprise.v3.admin.AppServerMBeanServerBuilder`
* `-Xmx512m`
* `-Dorg.glassfish.additionalOSGiBundlesToStart=org.apache.felix.shell,org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime,org.apache.felix.gogo.shell,org.apache.felix.gogo.command,org.apache.felix.shell.remote,org.apache.felix.fileinstall`
* `-Dosgi.shell.telnet.port=6666`
* `-Dosgi.shell.telnet.maxconn=1`
* `-Dosgi.shell.telnet.ip=127.0.0.1`
* `-Dgosh.args=--nointeractive`
* `-Dfelix.fileinstall.dir=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/modules/autostart/`
* `-Dfelix.fileinstall.poll=5000`
* `-Dfelix.fileinstall.log.level=2`

* `-Dfelix.fileinstall.bundles.startTransient=true`
* `-Dfelix.fileinstall.disableConfigSave=false`
* `-Dcom.ctc.wstx.returnNullForDefaultNamespace=true`

The following JVM options appear in both `domain` and `payaradomain`:

* `-Djava.awt.headless=true`
* `-Djdk.corba.allowOutputStreamSubclass=true`
* `-Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=all`
* `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions`
* `-Djava.endorsed.dirs=${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/modules/endorsed${path.separator}${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/endorsed`
