= Health Check Service

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.161_

Payara Server includes a Health Check Service that is disabled by default.
When enabled it periodically checks the following performance metrics:

* Host CPU Usage
* Host Memory Usage
* Payara Server’s JVM Garbage Collections
* Payara Server’s JVM Heap Usage
* CPU Usage of individual threads
* Detects stuck threads

If there is a problem with any of these metrics and they exceed a
configurable threshold then a `GOOD`, `WARNING` or `CRITICAL` event
message is logged to the server log file.

This allows operations teams to rapidly detect problems or work out what happened after these
problems have occurred. Such events will be presented like in the following
sample:
