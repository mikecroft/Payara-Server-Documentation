[[health-check-service]]
= Health Check Service Configuration


The Health Check service configuration is stored in the `domain.xml`. An
example can be seen below:

[source, xml]
----
<health-check-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <garbage-collector-checker unit="SECONDS" name="GC" time="5" enabled="true"></garbage-collector-checker>
    <cpu-usage-checker unit="SECONDS" name="CPU" time="5" enabled="true">
        <property name="threshold-critical" value="90"></property>
        <property name="threshold-warning" value="70"></property>
        <property name="threshold-good" value="0"></property>
    </cpu-usage-checker>
    <machine-memory-usage-checker enabled="true" unit="SECONDS" name="MMEM" time="5">
        <property name="threshold-critical" value="95"></property>
        <property name="threshold-warning" value="60"></property>
        <property name="threshold-good" value="20"></property>
    </machine-memory-usage-checker>
    <heap-memory-usage-checker unit="SECONDS" name="HEAP" time="5" enabled="true">
        <property name="threshold-critical" value="92"></property>
        <property name="threshold-warning" value="75"></property>
        <property name="threshold-good" value="15"></property>
    </heap-memory-usage-checker>
</health-check-service-configuration>
----

The main configuration tag is the `<health-check-service-configuration>`
which can be found directly under the parent `config` tag,
`<config name="server-config">` for example. It has only one attribute
named `enabled`, which can be set to either `true` or `false` to turn
the entire Healthcheck service **on** or **off**.

[[the-list-of-available-checkers]]
== The List of Available Checkers

`<health-check-service-configuration>` can contain a variety of
checkers, each of which do specific monitoring on the listed metrics:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description
|`<cpu-usage-checker>` |Calculates the CPU usage and prints out the
percentage along with the usage time.
|`<garbage-collector-checker>` |Calculates and prints out how many times
GC is executed with its elapsed time.
|`<machine-memory-usage-checker>` |Calculates the machine memory usage
and prints out the percentage along with the total and used physical
memory size.
|`<heap-memory-usage-checker>` |Calculates the heap memory usage and
prints out the percentage along with initial and committed heap sizes.
|`<hogging-threads-checker>` |Identifies the threads that are hogging
the CPU.
|`<connection-pool-checker>` |Calculates the ratio of free/used
connections available for all JDBC connections pool an prints the
percentage of used connections for each active pool.
|=======================================================================

They all have the following base attributes, that need to be specified:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description
|`enabled` |Enables or disables the specified checker.
|`name` |Name of the checker that will be printed in the log messages
for tracing.
|`unit` |The time unit value, which could either be: `NANOSECONDS`,
`MICROSECONDS`, `MILLISECONDS`, `SECONDS`, `HOURS`, `DAYS`.
|`time` |The time interval value (as an `Integer`) specified in given unit
to execute the checker for the metric.
|=======================================================================

[[threshold-configurations]]
= Threshold configurations

Just like with the
link:asadmin-commands.adoc#healthcheck-configure-service-threshold[`healthcheck-configure-service-threshold` asadmin command],
there are threshold configurations for the following checkers:

* `<cpu-usage-checker>`
* `<machine-memory-usage-checker>`
* `<heap-memory-usage-checker>`
* `<connection-pool-checker>`

The threshold configurations are specified for 3 different levels:
`CRITICAL`, `WARNING` and `GOOD`. By default their values are *`80`*,
*`50`* and *`0`* respectively. A sample configuration for the
`cpu-usage-checker` is given as follows:

[source, xml]
----
<cpu-usage-checker enabled="true" unit="SECONDS" name="CPU" time="3">
    <property name="threshold-critical" value="90"></property>
    <property name="threshold-warning" value="70"></property>
    <property name="threshold-good" value="0"></property>
</cpu-usage-checker>
----

IMPORTANT: All threshold values must be provided, otherwise the
configuration will not work appropriately and will cause a startup
error.

[[checkers-with-customized-configuration]]
== Checkers with Customized Configuration

[[garbage-collector-checker]]
=== `<garbage-collector-checker>`

There are no configurable options to set for the *Garbage Collection checker*.
The checker is either on or off.

[[hogging-threads-checker]]
=== `<hogging-threads-checker>`

The Hogging Threads checker offers the following 2 properties for
configuration:

`threshold-percentage`:: Defines the minimum percentage needed to count
the thread is hogged CPU-wise. The percentage is calculated with the
ratio of elapsed CPU time to checker execution interval. It default
value is _95_.
`retry-count`:: Represents the count value that should be reached by
the hogged thread in order to give health check messages to the user.
Its default value is 3.

Here is a sample for this configuration in the _domain.xml_:

[source, xml]
----
<health-check-service-configuration enabled="true">
      <hogging-threads-checker unit="MINUTES" time="1" enabled="true" threshold-percentage="65" retry-count="10"></hogging-threads-checker>
</health-check-service-configuration>
