= XMPP Notifier

The **Ex**tensible **M**essaging and **P**resence **P**rotocol is a
communication protocol based on *XML* notation, focused through the
exchange of structured messages across services and devices on multiple
network arrangements and targeted towards Message Oriented Middleware.
Formerly known as *Jabber*, XMPP is an open standard, which means that
anyone can implement toolsets used to send and receive messages across
its implementations.

[[xmpp-server-configuration]]
== XMPP Server Configuration

XMPP works using a _client-server_ architecture, akin to other messaging
solutions like Hipchat, Slack or IRC for example. Unlike those, XMPP is
*decentralized*, which means that any person or organization can run its
own server using a proprietary domain (which can be public or private
depending of the user needs). There are multiple server implementations
in the market, with both open source and commercial licensing models
like the following:

* https://mina.apache.org/vysper-project[Apache Vysper] (Open Source)
* https://www.oracle.com/industries/communications/enterprise/products/instant-messaging/index.html[Oracle
Communications Instant Messaging Server] (Commercial)
* http://igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp[OpenFire] (Open
Source)
* https://www.communigate.com/default.html[CommuniGate Pro] (Commercial)
* http://jabberd2.org/[Jabberd 2] (Open Source)

No matter what XMPP server you or your organization is using, the Payara
XMPP Notifier Service will be able to communicate with it and push
notifications to a specific chat room hosted on the server.

[[requirements]]
=== Requirements

The following are the requirements needed to be fulfilled by the XMPP
server:

. Configure the XMPP server with a valid domain name/FQDN
. If considering secure communication, the XMPP server must have a valid
SSL certificate configured for its FQDN
. Configure the service for text-based conferencing (this service is
usually named *conference* and is a subdomain of the server)
. Create room that will be used to receive the notifications sent by
Payara Server.
. Create a user that is allowed to access the room created and push
notification messages.

We will use _OpenFire_ to illustrate how to correctly configure these
requirements and the notifier. If you are using a different server, check its
documentation and follow its instructions based on what's being done here.

[[openfire-configuration]]
=== OpenFire Configuration

. Proceed to download and install the OpenFire server by following the
instructions detailed
http://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/install-guide.html[here].
Once the server is installed, start the OpenFire service and head to the
server's admin console located at `http://{FQDN}:9090/`

. Since the server was recently installed it will prepare a bootstrapping
wizard. First, select the language that will be used by the
administration interface:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-install-1.png[OpenFire Language Select Screen]

. Now, proceed to configure the domain name and _FQDN_ of your server. You
can also alter the ports for the admin console and configure secure
access using property encryption if necessary:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-install-2.png[OpenFire Server Settings Screen]

. To use OpenFire on production environments, its recommended to install
an external database used to store its configuration and data. For the
sake of simplicity, we will use the embedded option instead:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-install-3.png[OpenFire Database Select Screen]

. Next, we have to configure the user data store that will back the
server's authentication. Generally speaking, is not uncommon that an
organization uses a **LDAP** directory to store profiles so that option is
recommended on production environments. As with the previous
configuration we will use the simpler option:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-install-4.png[OpenFire Profile Screen]

. Finally, configure the credentials for the *admin* user:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-install-5.png[OpenFire Admin User Screen]

. With the server installation complete, login to the admin console with
the credentials of the administrator user:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-login.png[OpenFire Login]

. Now we need to create the user that will be used to push notifications
on the service's room. Select the *User/Groups* option in the top menu:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-users-1.png[OpenFire User Summary]

. Click on the *Create New User* option in the sidebar. Input the
information for this new user (*Username*, *Name* and *Password* are
required):
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-users-2.png[OpenFire New User]

. With the user created, we will proceed to create the room used to
display notifications. Select the *Group Chat* option in the top menu:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-create-room-1.png[OpenFire Room Summary]

. Now, click on the *Create New Room* option in the sidebar. Be sure to
input the room's *ID*, *Name* and *Description* as requested:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-create-room-2.png[OpenFire New Room]

. Check that the room was created successfully. Click on the room's link
to enter its details. Take special note of the *Service Name*, which
will be used to configure the notifier later:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-room-details.png[OpenFire Room Details]

. Finally, select the *Permissions* option in the sidebar and add the user
we created earlier in the *Room Occupants* section. You can do this by
searching using its username in the search box:
+
image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/openfire-room-permissions.png[OpenFire Room Permissions]

With this, the XMPP server configuration is completed.

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

With the XMPP server properly configured, now it's time to setup the
_Notification Service_ in the domain's configuration. As usual you can
do this using the administration web console, from the command line or
editing the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

The configuration settings required by the service are the following:

_Server's Location_::
 _Hostname_ and _Port_ where the XMPP is listening for requests.
The hostname is required, the port defaults to _*5222*_ if not provided.
_Service name_::
Used by the XMPP server to manage group chat sessions, always required.
_Room ID_::
The ID of the room that will be used to host the notification events,
always required.
_Credentials_::
The _Username_ and _Password_ of the user that will post notification events
in the room.

TIP: You can also configure an option whether or not to disable security
transport (SSL) when establishing communication to the server. The
default value for this setting is `false`. It's not recommended to
disable secure access on production environments, so use it with
discretion.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go
to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Notification Service_ and click on the *XMPP* tab:

image:/images/notification-service/xmpp/admin-console-configuration.png[XMPP Notifier in Admin Console]

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) and input the required information.

Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the
`notification-xmpp-configure` asadmin command, specifying the
configuration options like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > notification-xmpp-configure --enabled=true --dynamic=true --hostname="172.28.128.3" --port=5222 --username="payara_notifier" --password="******" --securityDisabled=false --roomid=server
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable
the XMPP notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the XMPP notifier
using the `get-xmpp-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-xmpp-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Host          Port  Service Name            Username         Password  Security Disabled  Room ID
true     172.28.128.3  5222  conference.payara.fish  payara_notifier  payara    true               server
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== On the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration file,
locate the `notification-service-configuration element` in the tree and insert
the `xmpp-notifier-configuration` with the respective configuration attributes
like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <xmpp-notifier-configuration room-id="server" service-name="conference.payara.fish" password="******" security-disabled="true" host="172.28.128.3" username="payara_notifier"></xmpp-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the XMPP notifier, it can be used to
push notifications to your configured server. You can visualize the
messages in a XMPP client of your choice. If you do not see any
notification event messages in the client, check the following:

* Is the XMPP notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Is the XMPP server correctly configured?
* Is there a firewall between both servers that is correctly configured
to allow sending messages in the respective port?
* Are the room permissions configured correctly?
* If using secure transport, is the server configured with a valid SSL
certificate for its _FQDN_?

Here's a sample of how the notifications are visualized on a chat room
using the https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/[Spark] XMPP
client:
