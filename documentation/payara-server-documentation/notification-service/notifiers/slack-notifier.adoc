[[slack-notifier]]
= Slack Notifier

https://slack.com/[Slack] is a functional enterprise chat and team
collaboration tool inspired by IRC. It allows an organization to create
specific *domains* and discuss work topics or subjects in separate
*channels* that can either be public or private.

Payara Server includes a special notifier to send notifications from the
link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification service]
to an organization's domain channel using Slack API integrations.

[[slack-integration-configuration]]
== Slack Integration Configuration

In order to allow the notification service to log events on a Slack
channel of your choice, you must fulfill the following requirements
first:

* Have created a Slack account within your organization's domain (for
example *payara.slack.com*)
* Have an Slack account with granted permissions to create channels and
configure API integrations.
* Have created a Slack channel which will be used by the notification
service to report notification events.

Once you have completed these requirements, you can configure an
https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks[Incoming Webhook integration]
for the channel. An _Incoming Webhook_ is the simplest integration
mechanism that Slack provides, in that they make use of normal HTTP
requests with a _JSON_ payload that includes the message text and
additional options to format incoming messages to the channel.

[[configure-incoming-webhook]]
=== Configure Incoming WebHook

. First, access the developer portal's application directory located at
https://payara.slack.com/apps. Then, in the search box type *Incoming Webhooks*.
A suggestion will appear in the results display:
+

. Now, proceed to select the channel that the WebHook will use to direct
the notification events to:
+
image:/images/notification-service/slack/channel-selection.png[Incoming WebHook Channel Selection]
+
NOTE: It's recommended to choose a _private_ channel, since it will keep these
notifications events protected in case of unwanted disclosure and it won't
spam other users of your organization with unwanted notifications

. With this, the WebHook configuration is finished. Now, take special
attention to the WebHook URL, which is usually follows this structure:
+
`https://hooks.slack.com/services/{TOKEN1}/{TOKEN2}/{TOKEN3}`
+
Like in the following sample:
+
image:/images/notification-service/slack/webhook-url.png[WebHook URL Sample]
+
We will use these 3 tokens when configuring the server's integration
later.
+
We recommend that you configure the following settings in the
channel integration to give better visualization for your notifications:
+
* *Descriptive Label*: Use a well descripted text to identify this
WebHook integration
* *Customize Name*: Insert a name for the "agent" that will report the
notification messages
* *Customize Icon*: Insert a custom icon to identify the agent that will
be visualized in the messages We recommend using one of the Payara logos
like in this sample:

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

With the Incoming WebHook properly configured, now it's time to setup
the Notification Service in the domain configuration. As usual you can
do this using the administration web console, from the command line or
editing the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go
to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] ->
Notification Service_ and click on the *Slack* tab:

image:/images/notification-service/slack/admin-console-configuration.png[Slack Configuration on Admin Console]

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to
restart the domain) and input the three tokens highlighted in the
previous section. Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the
`notification-slack-configure` asadmin command, specifying the tokens
like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > notification-slack-configure --enabled=true --dynamic=true --token1=T43CHENUC --token2=B441EFQB1 --token3=Jas8P3jCZ4wK8Y2m88dCxGkn
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable
the Slack notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the Slack notifier
using the `get-slack-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-slack-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Token 1    Token 2    Token 3
true     T43CHENUC  B441EFQB1  Jas8P3jCZ4wK8Y2m88dCxGkn
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== On the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration
file, locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the
tree and insert the `slack-notifier-configuration` with the respective
attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <slack-notifier-configuration token1="T43CHENUC" token2="B441EFQB1" token3="Jas8P3jCZ4wK8Y2m88dCxGkn" enabled="true"></slack-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration
method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the Slack notifier, it can be used to
push notifications to your configured channel. If you do not see any
notification event messages, check the following:

* Is the Slack notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the
HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to
observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Is the *Incoming WebHook* correctly configured in the Slack API
portal?
* Check that you have not surpassed the current
https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits[rate limit for the Slack API]

Here's a sample of how the notifications are visualized on the Slack
Desktop application:
