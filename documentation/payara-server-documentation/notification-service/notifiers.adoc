= Notifiers

The notification service comes with an integrated set of notifiers that
can be used to send notification events to a distinct variety of
channels apart from the standard server log mechanism:

*Email*:: Taking advantage of preconfigured Java Mail sessions in the
server, you can route notifications to an email account
*JMS*:: Taking advantage of preconfigured JMS connection resources, you
can route notifications to a Java Message Queue so it can be consumed by
other applications or services
*Event Bus*:: If Hazelcast is enabled, it's possible to send
notification events using Hazelcast's event bus.
*Hipchat*:: You can configure the notification service to send events
to an specific Hipchat chat room.
*Slack*:: Same as with the Hipchat notifier, you can sends
notifications directly to an specific Slack channel.
*SNMP*:: Allows monitoring servers to scout for notification events
using SNMP traps.
*XMPP*:: Allows sending notification events to XMPP servers.

Appropriate instructions on how to configure and use all of these
notification mechanisms are included in this section.
