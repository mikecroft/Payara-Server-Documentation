JACC stands for *Java Authentication Contract for Containers*. It's defined in
the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=115[JSR 115 specification] and all Java
EE complaint servers are mandated to provide a JACC Policy by default.

== How to install a custom JACC provider

Having coded a JACC provider, the first thing to do it is to make these
classes available for the server. For that purpose, you need to put the implementation JAR, with all its dependencies, under the `{PAYARA_HOME}/lib` folder.

The next thing to do is to tell Payara you want to use the custom JACC
provider. To do this, you have to execute the following administration command:

[source, shell]
----
create-jacc-provider
--policyConfigurationFactoryProvider=com.example.CustomPolicyConfigurationFactory
--policyProvider=com.example.CustomPolicy --target=server-config custom-provider set configs.config.server-config.security-service.jacc=custom-provider
----

This will result in the following configuration element added to the _domain.xml_ file:

[source, xml]
----
<security-service jacc="custom-provider">
    <jacc-provider policy-provider="com.example.CustomPolicy" name="custom-provider"
      policy-configuration-factory-provider="com.example.CustomPolicyConfigurationFactory">
    </jacc-provider>
    <!-- More providers can be defined -->
</security-service>
----

As you can see on the XML excerpt, more JACC providers can be defined
(by default, the `simple` and `default` providers are already defined),
but only one will be used at runtime, specified by the `jacc` attribute
on the `security-service` element.
