== JDBC Connection Validation Changes

Starting from _Payara 4.1.1.171_ the validators `table` and `custom-validation` now
take the connection pool's _Statement Timeout_ into account. Previously
the lack of timeouts would lead to validators endlessly waiting for a
response, causing unwanted side effects.

For details on the new capabilities of Payara Server connection pools,
see the link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/advanced-jdbc/advanced-jdbc-configuration-and-diagnostics.adoc[Advanced
JDBC Configuration and Diagnostics] article page in the extended documentation.
