= Elements of the Deployment Descriptor Files

This page is a reference for extra elements added to the GlassFish proprietary
deployment descriptors


[[classloading-delegate]]
== `classloading-delegate`

With this option its possible to enable/disable *class loading delegation*.
This allows deployed application to use libraries included on them,
overriding the versions included on the server.

For more information about how class delegation can be configured on
Payara Server, see the
link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/classloading.adoc[Enhanced Class loading] section.

[[whitelist-package]]
== `whitelist-package`

Used to whitelist packages on link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/classloading.adoc#extreme-classloading-isolation[*extreme class loading isolation*].
Whitelisted packages are taken into account by the server when scanning
libraries.

For more information about how extreme class loading isolation works on
Payara Server, see the
link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/classloading.adoc[Enhanced Classloading] section.

[[enable-implicit-cdi]]
== `enable-implicit-cdi`

In a *WAR* file, it is possible to set the property `bean-discovery-mode`
equal to `none` to turn off implicit scanning of the archive for bean
defining annotations, as defined by the _CDI 1.1_ specification. The
default value of this setting is defined as `annotated` in the specification,
so the archive is scanned for any bean-defining annotations, which can cause
unwanted side effects.

In the `glassfish-application.xml` deployment descriptor for an EAR
file, the property `enable-implicit-cdi` can be set to `false` to
achieve the same goal for all modules inside the EAR assembly. The
default value is `true`, in line with the default value for WAR files.

If implicit CDI scanning causes problems for an EAR assembly, the value
`false` will disable implicit CDI scanning for all CDI modules inside
the EAR assembly:

[source, xml]
----
<glassfish-application>
  <enable-implicit-cdi>false</enable-implicit-cdi>
</glassfish-application>
----

The default behavior of the admin console is for the *Implicit CDI*
checkbox to be enabled, but this will *not* override the application
configuration.

IMPORTANT: When implicit CDI is configured by using either the
`enable-implicit-cdi` property in the `glassfish-application.xml` or the
attribute `bean-discovery-mode="none"` from the `beans.xml` file in a
WAR, the admin console checkbox _*is always ignored*_.

[[scanning-exclude-and-scanning-include]]
== `scanning-exclude` and `scanning-include`

Modern WAR and EAR files very often include a number of 3rd party JARs.
In situations where some JARs require CDI scanning and others may break
if scanned, these can now be explicitly included or excluded from such
component scanning.

Both the `glassfish-application.xml` and the `glassfish-web.xml` files
support the following directives:

[source, xml]
----
<scanning-exclude>*</scanning-exclude>
<scanning-include>ejba*</scanning-include>
<scanning-include>conflicting-web-library</scanning-include>
----

In the above example, all JARs will be excluded by default, then all
JARs beginning with `ejba` will be scanned along with the JAR named
`conflicting-web-library`.

[[container-initializer-enabled]]
== `container-initializer-enabled`

This property configures whether to enable or disable the calling of
`ServletContainerInitializer` component classes defined in JAR files
bundled inside a WAR assembly.

For performance considerations, you can explicitly disable the servlet
container initializer by setting the `container-initializer-enabled`
element to `false`. This can help solve the deployment of web applications
that can suffer from conflicts with a custom bootstrapping process.

The default value for this configuration element is `true`.

[[default-role-mapping]]
== `default-role-mapping`

With this property, you can set whether to enable the default group to
role mappings for your application's security settings. This element is
set up as a `property` element with a `Boolean` value attribute like
this:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="default-role-mapping" value="true">
  <description>Enable default group to role mapping</description>
</property>
----

Enabling the default group to role mappings will cause all named groups
in the application's linked security _realm_ to be mapped to a role of the
same name. This will save you the time of having to redefine the same
roles and map them to the realm groups each time they are modified.

This will have the same effect as executing the following `asadmin`
command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set configs.config.server-config.security-service.activate-default-principal-to-role-mapping=true
----

Except its effect will only limit itself to the application instead of
all applications deployed on the server. This setting is configured by
default to `true` on the
link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/production-ready-domain.adoc[production-ready-domain]

The default value of this property is `false`. This property can be set
in the `glassfish-web.xml`, `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` and
`glassfish-application.xml` deployment descriptors.

In an EAR assembly, only the property set in the
`glassfish-application.xml` will take effect and if set in the
`glassfish-web.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`, it will be ignored.
Setting this configuration property in any of these files will always take
precedence over any setting configured on the server.

[[max-wait-time-in-millis]]
== `max-wait-time-in-millis`

From version 4.1.2.172, Payara Server has reimplemented a property of the
`glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` descriptor that was available in GlassFish in versions
prior to 4.0.

The `bean-pool` element allows users to specify controls on a per-EJB basis for
pooled stateless EJBs. Payara Server has reintroduced `max-wait-time-in-millis`
to govern what happens when the number of requests for an EJB exceeds the number
of beans available in the pool.

A value of `-1` disables the property and means that, when the pool is at
maximum usage and another request is made, a new EJB instance is created
immediately, with no upper bound.

A value of `0` means the server will wait indefinitely for an existing EJB
instance to be freed.

A value between `1` and `MAX_INTEGER` means that the server will wait for the
given amount of milliseconds for an EJB to be freed. Only after this 
`max-wait-time-in-millis` is exceeded will the server create a new instance of
the requested EJB.

For more detail, see the link:/documentation/payara-server-documentation/ejb.adoc[
Enhanced EJB configuration] section.
