= Request Tracing Configuration

The request tracing service configuration is stored in the `domain.xml`
file. As with any aspect of Payara Server configuration, we do not
recommend modifying the `domain.xml` due to the likelihood of typos
causing problems.

    threshold-unit="SECONDS"

    <log-notifier enabled="true"></log-notifier>
</request-tracing-service-configuration>

As shown above, there are three main attributes which can be configured,
in addition to a `log-notifier` sub-tag:

`threshold-value`:: This defines the number of units beyond which a request will be
traced.
`threshold-unit`:: This defines the time duration per unit. The accepted options are any
valid
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html[java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit]
values. By default the threshold value is *3 MINUTES*. In the snippet
given above, itâ€™s set to _30 SECONDS_.
`enabled`:: Whether or not the service is turned on

There is an additional configuration option which can be seen in the
admin console, or specified as an argument to the
link:asadmin-command.adoc[asadmin command] called `dynamic`. Setting this
to true will activate the change _without having to do a server restart._

WARNING: Not included in the admin console for release _4.1.1.164_ is an
option to set the notifier type. This is intentional for this
tech-preview release, since the general notifier service is released
with only one available notifier. When further notifiers are added, the
option to specify the type of notifier will be added.
